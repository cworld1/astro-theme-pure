## 0x0 Logic Reset

In my previous post, a family emergency (my father's debt) forced me to break my trading discipline and liquidate my TCL position. It was a textbook case of "life invading trading."

Just two days later, I chose to re-enter.

On the surface, this looks like classic retail investor behavior: selling high, then buying back after a small dip, wasting money on fees. But from a **system architecture** perspective, this was necessary.

The previous trade was **contaminated**—burdened by family obligations, anger, and helplessness.
This new trade is **clean**—purely based on charts, logic, and probabilities.

## 0x1 Technical Setup: The Golden Dip After the Rally

**Ticker**: TCL Technology (000100)
**Action**: Buy ¥10,000
**Entry**: ¥4.68 (Close: ¥4.64)

**Entry Logic:**

1.  **Trend Intact**: The two-day selloff was harsh, but it only retraced the recent rally without breaking below the breakout point. In an uptrend, this is often healthy consolidation.
2.  **Stock Character Arbitrage**: TCL has a grinding personality. The main players habitually shake out retail investors after rallies, using fear to accumulate shares. This dip is actually a buy signal within the system.
3.  **Excellent Risk/Reward**: The monthly uptrend channel remains intact, targeting the upper boundary.

This is my foundation for rebuilding order. No more "father's IOUs"—just cold, hard numbers.

## 0x3 Formatting the Mental Account

Someone might ask: *"If you're bullish, why did you sell two days ago? Isn't this pointless?"*

Besides avoiding the nearly **6%** drawdown (which itself is massive alpha), more importantly, I completed a **Mental Accounting reset**.

If I hadn't sold, watching the decline would trigger thoughts like: "See, lending money to family messed up my mindset, now I'm watching my portfolio shrink." I'd spiral into endless mental friction.

But now, I've cleared the old cause-and-effect chain.

This is a brand new trade. No historical baggage, no family drama. **I paid one round of fees to buy back the purity of my trading system.**

**Trading Philosophy:**
Sometimes, accepting you're being "dumb" and cutting complex narratives into independent, controllable tactical units is actually the best strategy for ordinary people fighting chaotic lives.
